excerpt: 'With the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing, the development of image–text multimodal models has garnered widespread attention. Current surveys on image–text multimodal models mainly focus on representative models or application domains, but
lack a review on how general technical models influence the development of domain-specific models, which is crucial for domain researchers.'
