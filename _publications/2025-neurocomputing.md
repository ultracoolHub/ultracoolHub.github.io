  The continuous development of artificial intelligence has a profound impact
  on biomedicine and other fields, providing new research ideas and technical
  methods. Brain-inspired computing is an important intersection between
  multimodal technology and biomedical field. Focusing on the application
  scenarios of decoding text and speech from brain signals in human-computer
  interaction, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the brain-inspired
  computing models based on deep learning (DL), tracking their evolution,
  application value, challenges and potential research trends. We first review its basic concepts and development history, and divide its
  evolution into two stages: recent machine learning and current deep learning,
  emphasizing the importance of each stage in the research of brain-inspired
  computing for human-computer interaction. In addition, the latest progress
  of deep learning in different tasks of brain-inspired computing for
  human-computer interaction is reviewed from five perspectives, including
  datasets and different brain signals, and the application of key technologies
  in the model is elaborated in detail. Despite significant advances in brain-inspired computational models,
  challenges remain to fully exploit their capabilities, and we provide insights
  into possible directions for future academic research. For more detailed
